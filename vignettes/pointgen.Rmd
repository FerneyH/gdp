## Introduction

We often need to **simulate locations at granular geographic levels** to test methods, perform spatial analyses, or visualize patterns. The `pointgen` package allows to generate **realistic event locations** for specific geometries (e.g., states or counties), respecting **population density** and **event rates**.

In this vignette, we will explore the `pointgen` package to:

1. Obtain population estimates.  
2. Simulate event locations over different geometries.  
4. Plot the results.
